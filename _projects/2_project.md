Large-scale deployment of fully autonomous vehicles requires a very high degree of robustness to unstructured traffic, weather conditions, and should prevent unsafe mispredictions. While there are several datasets and benchmarks focusing on segmentation for drive scenes, they are not specifically focused on safety and robustness issues. We introduce the IDD-AW dataset, which provides 5000 pairs of high-quality images with pixel-level annotations, captured under rain, fog, low light, and snow in unstructured driving conditions. As compared to other adverse weather datasets, we provide 

- more annotated images
-  paired Near-Infrared (NIR) image for each frame
- larger label set with a 4-level label hierarchy to capture unstructured traffic conditions. 

We benchmark state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation in IDD-AW. We also propose a new metric called" Safe mean Intersection over Union (Safe mIoU)" for hierarchical datasets which penalizes dangerous mispredictions that are not captured in the traditional definition of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The results show that IDD-AW is one of the most challenging datasets to date for these tasks. The dataset and code will be available at [IDDAW](https://iddaw.github.io)

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
