I am Nikhil Reddy Billa, a graduate student and researcher. I hold a B.Tech degree in Electrical Engineering from NIT Rourkela and previously worked as a Software Engineer at NCR Corporation. I am deeply interested in computer vision, and machine learning. My focus lies in autonomous navigation, domain adaptation, Generative AI, 3D vision and their applications in the medical field. I am eagerly explorING emerging areas like Large Language Models (LLMs).

My research includes CNN-based image resizing forensics, segmentation in unstructured traffic and adverse weather, and unsupervised domain adaptation for detecting retinal development. I have collaborated with IIIT Hyderabad and the University of Leicester on these projects.

Looking ahead, I am excited to start my MS in Computer Engineering in Fall 2024, where I aim to further my research in machine learning and computer vision. My goal is to drive innovations that address real-world challenges and enhance technological impact.

Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers and professionals in the field.
