I am **Nikhil Reddy Billa**, a **graduate student, researcher, and AI enthusiast**, currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech**.  I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the REDS Lab, where I focus on **LLM memorization, adversarial robustnes**. My research is driven by **innovation in AI with a strong emphasis on privacy, safety, and trustworthiness**.

Previously, I earned my **B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from NIT Rourkela** and worked as a **Software Engineer at NCR Corporation**, where I developed **AI-driven automation and anomaly detection systems**. My experience spans both **industry and academia**, allowing me to bridge **cutting-edge research with real-world AI applications**.  


My research spans multiple areas, including **AI security, computer vision, and autonomous navigation**.Currently I am working on **LLM memorization risks, adversarial robustness, and trustworthiness**, ensuring the safe deployment of AI models. My previous work in **computer vision and image forensics** involves developing **CNN-based techniques for digital integrity verification**, while my contributions to **autonomous navigation** focus on **enhancing segmentation models and data for unstructured traffic and adverse weather conditions**. Additionally, During my time at IIIT Hyderabad I have collaborated with University of Leicester on **unsupervised domain adaptation for medical AI**, specifically analyzing retinal development.  

Beyond research, I actively contribute to the AI community as a **Reviewer for the Journal of Information Security and Applications (Elsevier)**, evaluating research on **AI security and adversarial robustness**. I engage in **open-source collaborations** and stay at the forefront of **LLMs, multimodal AI, and AI ethics** to drive impactful innovations.  

I am actively seeking opportunities that align with my expertise, allowing me to **develop AI solutions that prioritize safety, privacy, and real-world impact**. Let’s connect and collaborate!
