      "summary": " We introduce the IDD-AW dataset, which provides 5000 pairs of high-quality images with pixel-level annotations, captured under rain, fog, low light, and snow in unstructured driving conditions. As compared to other adverse weather datasets, we provide i.) more annotated images, ii.) paired Near-Infrared (NIR) image for each frame, iii.) larger label set with a 4-level label hierarchy to capture unstructured traffic conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation in IDD-AW. We also propose a new metric called 'Safe mean Intersection over Union (Safe mIoU)' for hierarchical datasets which penalizes dangerous mispredictions that are not captured in the traditional definition of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU).
